4-bit/hangman.s

Hangman 2-player game for the 65C02 processor. This program has 3 phases: length, secret word, and guesses. The length phase prompts one user to enter the secret word's length the secret word phase prompts the same user to enter the secret word's characters in ascii binary the guesses phase prompts another player to make guesses of the letters that could be in the word

In this example, the secret word is 'Apple' and a player has already guessed E as a correct letter and has just guessed the letter 'P'. The incomplete word is on the right of the LCD, indicated by an 'x' character to represent that the character there hasn't been guessed yet. On the lefthand side, there is the current letter to be guessed by the player and in the center, there is a number of incorrect guesses left (default is 6). Once the player makes a guess, the incomplete word will autofill at any index that the guessed letter is at. For example, if the player now guesses 'A', the word on the right will display 'APPxE'. If a letter is guessed that is not in the secret word, the counter on the left will decrement.
